# AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS infrastructure is built for high availability, fault tolerance, and global scale. Key components:

- **Regions:** 33 (with more in development)
- **Availability Zones:** 105+
- **Local Zones:** 30+ (low latency + data residency)
- **Edge Locations:** 300+ for content delivery + performance

## Architecture Design Benefits:
- Redundancy
- Fault tolerance
- High performance
- Reduced latency (Edge Locations + Local Zones)
